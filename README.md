# Travel Log

A full stack application to keep track of your travels, create notes and post pictures about it

This project is a single repo that holds both the server and the client.
Originally was developed with NextJS, however, due to architecture decisions made in order to make this a better learning experience
this project now uses Vite and NodeJS, no Meta framework is involved for the time being
